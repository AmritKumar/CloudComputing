\title{Analysis of Security-Cost Trade-off of Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).

% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and

\section{Introduction(1 page)}
The homomorphic encryption allows few operations on encrypted data. Gentry was the first to establidh a fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on ideal lattices which allows operations on encrypted data
 but with a high cost. Since then many researches have been made trying to improve the schemes to establish more operations on encrypted data with less cost and better secutity in order to do computations on remote machines. 
In this article we study the implementation of basic classes of operations and different aspects of 
complexity-security, and we discuss the results of experimental measures based on several parameters.\\
The Gentry FHE protocol consists on ``somewhat homomorphic'' scheme, ``squashing'' and ``bootstrapping''. (explain later). 
There are variants of FHE schemes more optimized than Gentry's scheme, so we use in the experiments some open source implementations of these schemes.
\section{Fully homomorphic scheme(1 page)}

A general structure of the scheme.

\subsection{Two Variants of Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme}
A brief description of the two FHE schemes with their algorithmic complexity of the different stages in the scheme. 
-> Smart Vercauteren
-> BGV
Discuss the security of these schemes.



\begin{itemize}
\item Smart-Vercauteren scheme:\\
The scheme has 3 parameters: ($N, \nu, \mu$ ). The somewhat homomorphic scheme uses 5 algorithms: (\texttt{KeyGen}, \texttt{Encrypt}, \texttt{Decrypt}, \texttt{Add}, \texttt{Mult}}).
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{KeyGen}:
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(x)= x^{n}+1$
\item do
\begin{itemize}
\item $S(x)=_{R}(B_{\infty , N}(\nu/2)$
\item $G(x)=1+2.S(x)$
\item $p= resultant(G(x),F(x))$
\end{itemize}
until $p$ is prime
\item $D(x)=gcd(G(x),F(x))$ over $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$
\item $\alpha$: the unique root of $D(x)$
\item apply \texttt{fmpz\_poly\_xgcd} to obtain $Z(x)$ such that $Z(x).G(x)=p$ mod $F(x)$
\item $B=z_0$ mod $2p$
\item $PK = (p, \alpha)$ and $Sk = (p , B)$
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{Encrypt}($m \in \{0,1\} , PK$):
\begin{itemize}
\item $R(x)=_{R}(B_{\infty , N}(\mu/2)$
\item $C(x)=m+2.R(x)$
\item $c=C(\alpha) mod p$
\item return $c$
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{Decrypt}($c, SK$):
\begin{itemize}
\item $m= (c - round(c.B/p)) mod 2$
\item return $m$
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{Add}($c_1$, $c_2$, $PK$):
\begin{itemize}
\item $c_3=c_1+c_2 mod p$
\item return $c_3$
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{Mult}($c_1$, $c_2$, PK):
\begin{itemize}
\item $c_3=c_1.c_2 mod p$
\item return $c_3$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item BGV:
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Considered Implementations}

The library used, version, implementaion details, versions, references, modifications required, how-to-installl, how-to-use.Platforms accepted and other depedeices.\\
For the Smart-Vercauteren implementation we use the library libScarab v1.0.0 which requires the following libraries: GMP, FLINT, MPIR, MPFR.
\subsection{Intial set-up cost(The cost not depending on the actual program)}

Can be integrated with subsection 2.1 

\section{ Didactic example :  Min-Max of two integers (1 page)}
Min-Max of two bounded integers of n-btis.
\subsection{Input Program for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme}
\texttt{aIsGreater}($a=(a_{n-1},...,a_0}), b=(b_{n-1},...,b_0}$)):
\begin{itemize}
\item G= encrypt($0, PK$); Count= encrypt($1, PK$) \\
for $i \in $nbits-1 .. $0$
\begin{itemize}
\item tmp1= or($a_i.b_i , \neg(a_i).\neg(b_i)$)
\item tmp2= $a_i.\neg(b_i).$Count
\item Count= Count . tmp1
\item G= or(G, tmp2)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\texttt{min\_max}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item G= aIsGreater(a, b) 
\item max_i = or($a_i.G, b_i. \neg{G}$)
\item min_i = or($a_i.\neg{G}, b_i.G$)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theoretical Cost with the Schemes}

Analyse the cost of the program wrt SV, BGV.

The cost of this algorithm \texttt{aIsGreater} is:\\
 $2*encrypt+n*(3*encrypt+7*add+7*mul)$ .\\
The cost of this algorithm \texttt{min\_max} is:\\
$ encrypt+aIsGreater+2*n*(encrypt+3add+3mull)$\\
Thus this algorithm has $O(n^2)$ complexity. 

\subsection{Experimental Analysis}

Once for all analysis of common operations(KeyGen, Encrypt, Decrypt of 1 bit) varying the algorithmic and security parameters.


Measurements taken are CPU time, Wall Time, Memory Usage by varying the input size  and the algorithmic parameters. Noise reduction threshold.
\begin{itemize}
\item KeyGen\\
The measured time execution for KeyGen($N, \mu$)  for fixed values of parameters: $N=8$ and $\mu = 4$ shows a variation from 0.31 s to 13.41 s with mean = 2.726 s.\\
\item {Encryption and Decryption}\\


\item {Cost time of Min-Max program}\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  nbits  & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 &  9  & 10 \\
  \hline
  time(s) & 4.17 & 5.84 & 7.18 & 4.29 & 4.65 & 5.9 & 6.71 & 6.73\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}
\section{Choice of Benchmarks}

3 different classes of problems : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Operations on bits,
 \item operation on integers (possibility of extension on blocks and comparision with RSA and 
 \item branching
\end{itemize}

For each problem we propse the program, analyse their cost and eventually on security.

Why certain other programs cannot be executed under homomorphic encryption.

\section{Evaluation on the Benchmarks (1 page)}

Measurements on varying the parameters or the plaintext space. Evaluation of program dependent properties. 

\section{Analysis of the results}

Anlayze the results previously obtained and its impact on security and complexity. Comparisions of security-cost tradeoff with other schemes like RSA.
